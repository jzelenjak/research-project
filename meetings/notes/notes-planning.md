# Notes for the Research Plan

- You don't have to read papers fully

- This is not the waterfall model

- Is the model still useful?

- You have to look at everything from the perspective of a security analyst

- State an intuitive hypothesis at the level of security analyst (as concrete as possible, not just "worse performance")

- Was the hypothesis correct?

- Metric might say that graphs are not complex, but from the perspective of analyst it might be hard to use and understand. **Don't blindly trust the metric!**

- This is what I get if I run vanilla SAGE, this is what I get when I merge sinks
    - The first graph is better in ...
    - ..., hence we incorrectly believe that this has happened

- Avoid wrong conclusions

- Final week: interpretability, manually analyse + collaboration, rank

- Initial comparison is manual, later automate (this is not the priority)
